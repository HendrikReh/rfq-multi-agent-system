### 2025-06-22: Test Organization & Structure 🧪
**Major Improvement**: Organized the test suite into a proper directory structure following testing best practices.

**Test Migration Completed**:
- **Migrated 8 test files** from root directory to organized structure
- **Moved 5 demo files** to `examples/` directory for better organization
- **Created comprehensive test configuration** with `conftest.py` and `__init__.py` files
- **Updated test runner** with proper import paths and directory structure

**New Test Structure**:
```
tests/
├── unit/test_agents/          # Unit tests for individual agents
│   ├── test_enhanced_agents.py
│   └── test_model_assignment.py
├── integration/               # Multi-agent workflow tests
│   ├── test_evaluations.py
│   ├── test_verification.py
│   ├── test_scenario_recording.py
│   └── test_simple.py
├── performance/               # Performance and scalability tests
│   └── test_performance.py
├── fixtures/                  # Test data and fixtures
├── conftest.py               # Global test configuration
├── run_all_tests.py          # Comprehensive test runner
└── README.md                 # Test documentation
```

**Enhanced Test Infrastructure**:
- **Automated test configuration**: Global `ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False` setup
- **Convenient test runner**: `test_runner.py` in project root for easy access
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Detailed README in tests directory
- **Migration tooling**: Added `migrate-tests` command to migration script
- **Updated project README**: Added comprehensive testing section

**Test Organization Benefits**:
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Easier CI/CD integration**: Standard pytest directory structure
- **Better test discovery**: Organized by test type and component
- **Improved maintainability**: Logical grouping and documentation
- **Developer experience**: Simple commands and clear structure

**Usage Commands**:
```bash
# Run all tests (recommended)
python test_runner.py

# Run from tests directory
cd tests && python run_all_tests.py

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/ -v               # Unit tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v        # Integration tests
pytest tests/performance/ -v        # Performance tests
```

## Future Enhancements
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Web interface with FastAPI/FastHTML
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Docker deployment configuration
- Real-time conversation handling
- Multi-language support
- Scenario comparison and benchmarking tools
- Export capabilities for external analysis
